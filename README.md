# Olympic-Data-analysis

The Olympic games have been popular all over
the world for decades. Every year we get new champions and
participants. As per our research, we found an article on Kaggle
and found a historical dataset of 2.8 million records including
all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. So, we have
decided to analyze the data using MongoDB. In every Olympic
year, there are new participants and new champions in different
games and countries. We know the benefits and functionality
of MongoDB like it varies, is easy to scale, supports dynamic
queries and easy to install and setup. Based on data available of
Olympics predictions can also be done about the response of new
games, new participants and many more. We have not worked
on MongoDB before; that is why we selected it because it will
be a new skill to develop and experience for us.
